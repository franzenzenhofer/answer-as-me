# Answer As Me - Enhanced Features Documentation

## ü§ñ AI Assistant Identity System

### Overview
The AI now operates as your personal email assistant, developing a deep understanding of who you are and how you communicate.

### Key Components

#### 1. **Assistant Persona**
- Introduces itself as YOUR assistant (not a generic AI)
- Knows your email address, name, and role
- Drafts emails AS you, not about you
- Maintains your professional reputation

#### 2. **User Profile System**
```typescript
interface UserProfile {
  email: string
  name?: string
  identity: {
    role: string
    expertise: string[]
    communicationStyle: string
  }
  personality: {
    formality: 1-5
    directness: 1-5
    warmth: 1-5
    detailLevel: 1-5
  }
  patterns: {
    greetings: { formal/casual/client }
    closings: { formal/casual/client }
  }
  vocabulary: {
    common: string[]
    avoided: string[]
    professional: string[]
  }
  rules: string[]
}
```

#### 3. **Relationship Intelligence**
- Detects recipient type (colleague, client, external)
- Adjusts tone based on relationship
- Learns from past interactions
- Maintains appropriate formality levels

## üìö Learn from Thread Feature

### How It Works
1. **Detection**: When viewing an email thread, the system checks if you've sent any messages in it
2. **UI Display**: Shows "Learn from this Thread" button only for threads with your messages
3. **Learning Process**: 
   - Extracts your communication patterns from the thread
   - Updates both writing style and user profile
   - Merges new insights with existing knowledge
   - No need to reanalyze all emails

### Benefits
- **Incremental Learning**: Improve understanding from specific conversations
- **Context-Specific**: Learn from important or unique interactions
- **Continuous Improvement**: Your assistant gets better over time
- **Efficient**: No need to reprocess 200 emails

## üéØ Enhanced Prompts System

### Modular Prompt Architecture
```typescript
// Identity Establishment
Prompts.getAssistantIdentityPrompt(userEmail, userName)

// Style Analysis with Identity Focus
Prompts.getStyleAnalysisPrompt(userEmail)

// Response Generation as Assistant
Prompts.getResponseGenerationPrompt(context, style, userProfile, instructions)

// Thread-Based Improvement
Prompts.getStyleImprovementPrompt(currentProfile, threadContent)
```

### Prompt Improvements
1. **Clear Role Definition**: AI knows it's YOUR assistant
2. **Context Awareness**: Understands relationships and history
3. **Personality Matching**: Maintains your communication style
4. **Professional Boundaries**: Protects your reputation

## üîß Technical Implementation
