Yes—additional critical issues to address beyond the earlier list:

1) OAuth scopes are overly broad; privacy and review risk
- Evidence: `appsscript.json` includes `gmail.modify`, `gmail.send`, `drive`, `documents`, full `gmail.readonly`, debug writes to Drive by default.
- Impact: Higher friction in Google Workspace Marketplace review; unnecessary access increases blast radius if bugs/leaks occur.
- Fix: Minimize scopes. If you only create docs on demand, request `documents`/`drive` only when user triggers prompt creation (or move prompts to a single doc created once). Consider removing `gmail.modify` if not labeling; keep `gmail.send`, `compose`, `addons.current.*` scopes. Make debug logging opt-in and avoid Drive writes unless enabled.

2) Gmail add-on runtime/UX risks: heavy I/O in card rendering violates add-on best practices
- Evidence: Card builders call Drive/Docs and Spreadsheet operations (prompt creation, debug spreadsheet fetching). Gmail add-ons are latency-sensitive; long operations can cause rendering failures.
- Impact: Timeouts, blank cards, user confusion.
- Fix: Strictly avoid Drive/Docs/UrlFetch in card build functions. Only do I/O in explicit action handlers with notifications/spinners.

3) Potential repeated execution ID collisions in DebugLogger
- Evidence: `sessionId` generated with `Utilities.getUuid().substring(0, 8)` per log line—not persisted for a session, so each row has a different “session”.
- Impact: Hard to correlate; not a crash, but observability is misleading when debugging incidents.
- Fix: Cache a session ID per invocation (e.g., in `PropertiesService.getUserProperties()` with a short TTL or in a global variable for the invocation) and reuse it for all logs in that execution.

4) “Factory Reset” incorrectly deletes and then recreates prompt docs
- Evidence: It loops over `['main','style','profile']` and calls `GoogleDocsPrompts.getOrCreatePromptDocument(promptType)` before attempting to trash—this creates missing docs and then tries to delete, but ‘main’ is invalid and others are not your canonical types.
- Impact: Fails to delete real prompt docs (`SETTINGS|OVERVIEW|THREAD`), may create extra docs. Confusing and leaves data behind.
- Fix: Read doc IDs from the known keys: `AAM_PROMPT_DOC_SETTINGS/OVERVIEW/THREAD`. If present, trash those files. Don’t call getOrCreate during reset.

5) Draft update flow is incomplete
- Evidence: `saveAsDraft` accepts `draftId` but if `updateDraft` fails, it doesn’t create a new draft; it just notifies success regardless of whether a new draft was created.
- Impact: User thinks draft saved, but nothing updated/created.
- Fix: On update failure or missing `draftId`, create a new draft reply and return the new `draftId`. Update the response card with the correct id.

6) `GmailService.getCurrentMessage` null-check insufficient for common Gmail add-on edge cases
- Evidence: Only checks `e.gmail.messageId`. For some contextual triggers, you can get calendar invites, bounced messages, or missing bodies. Downstream assumes `.getPlainBody()` always exists.
- Impact: Exceptions in context extraction; you catch some but not all.
- Fix: Harden: if `getPlainBody()` is empty/null or over size, handle gracefully; use `.getRawContent()` as fallback only if needed; keep strict size truncation.

7) Response generation without cancellation/timeout awareness
- Evidence: `UrlFetchApp.fetch` can block; you use backoff but not an overall per-action timeout guard in handlers.
- Impact: Add-on actions can exceed Gmail add-on time limits in poor network conditions.
- Fix: Add an overall stopwatch in handlers and abort subsequent steps if elapsed time exceeds e.g., 20s; notify user to retry.

8) Missing per-user rate limiting/backoff after 429s
- Evidence: `AI.callGeminiAPI` maps 429 to a message but doesn’t set a cool-off marker; retries may occur immediately from user clicks.
- Impact: Users stuck in rate-limit loops; unnecessary calls.
- Fix: Store a short “retryAfterMs” in user properties when 429 occurs; show UI notification “please wait X seconds” and block generation until then.

9) Prompt variable substitution lacks escaping
- Evidence: `GoogleDocsPrompts.getPrompt` replaces `{{key}}` with raw values. Some values like `context` include newlines or symbols.
- Impact: Not security-critical (Docs text to API), but can break formatting; double braces in user content could be misinterpreted.
- Fix: Escape curly braces in values or perform substitution with a non-conflicting delimiter. Consider limiting variable values’ length.

10) Mixed content in UI `TextParagraph` with HTML
- Evidence: Some `TextParagraph` strings contain HTML tags (`<b>`, `<a>`). CardService supports simple formatting, but HTML rendering is limited and can vary.
- Impact: Some clients may render raw tags, hurting UX.
- Fix: Prefer CardService widgets (`DecoratedText`, `KeyValue`, `TextButton`) for emphasis/links instead of inline HTML.

11) Average sentence length computed over cleaned body but truncates previous messages differently
- Evidence: Context extraction truncates previous messages to 5,000 chars, but style analyzer uses raw recent sent emails; inconsistency can bias prompts vs analyzer expectations.
- Impact: Minor drift in style vs prompt; could reduce quality.
- Fix: Standardize truncation and cleaning rules across analysis and prompts.

12) No locale/i18n handling for dates, pluralization, RTL
- Evidence: Dates formatted with `Session.getScriptTimeZone()` and hardcoded `MMM dd, yyyy HH:mm`.
- Impact: Poor UX for non-English locales.
- Fix: Use `Utilities.formatDate` with user locale where possible; account for RTL in UI if audience is multilingual.

13) Potential double-submission without idempotency guard
- Evidence: `generateResponse` doesn’t guard against rapid double clicks; could create multiple drafts.
- Impact: Duplicate drafts; user confusion.
- Fix: Add a per-thread in-flight flag in user properties for short TTL; or disable button via a client state response.

14) Search saturation in `getRecentSentEmails`
- Evidence: Uses `GmailApp.search('in:sent', 0, limit)` but then iterates all messages in each thread; may exceed desired limit quickly; also returns only bodies.
- Impact: Quota usage and performance drag.
- Fix: Use `GmailApp.search('in:sent newer_than:1y')` and stop at `limit` messages; or traverse drafts/messages carefully counting messages not threads.

15) Potential leakage of signature/content in prompts to Gemini
- Evidence: `Prompts.getOverviewPrompt` injects full `context.body` and thread snippets—these are user emails. This is intended, but combined with DebugLogger storing prompts/responses, risk increases.
- Impact: Data-at-rest risk.
- Fix: With DebugLogger fixed/opt-in, this is acceptable for user-initiated generation. Ensure you clearly document data flow.

If you want, I can produce a prioritized patch plan (1-hour, half-day, 1-day buckets) to address the most impactful issues first.
